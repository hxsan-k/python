# Python Practice & Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and personal projects to document my learning and to serve as a learning resource for beginners. 

## Repository Structure 📁

- `exercises/` – my solutions to beginner-friendly exercises from FreeCodeCamp  
- `projects/` – my personal Python projects (coming soon).

## Notes & Goals 📝

- All code in this repository is written independantly by me to reinforce Python fundamentals, however exercises are taken from platforms such as FreeCodeCamp.  
- Exercises focus on topics such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and basic algorithms.  
- The goal of this repository is both to track my progress and provide examples for beginners who are learning Python.
